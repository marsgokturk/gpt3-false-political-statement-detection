# Assessing the Effectiveness of GPT-3 in Detecting False Political Statements

This repository contains the code and data used in our academic paper: "Assessing the Effectiveness of GPT-3 in Detecting False Political Statements: A Case Study on the LIAR Dataset".

## Project Description

In this project, we probe the capabilities of GPT-3, an advanced language model by OpenAI, in identifying false political statements. Our study is anchored on two primary experiments: the fine-tuning of GPT-3 and its application in a zero-shot learning context. Both experiments leverage the LIAR dataset, an established benchmark resource curated by William Yang Wang from the Politifact website specifically for fake news detection tasks.

4. `results/`: This directory contains the experimental results, including model performance metrics.

## Setup & Usage

To reproduce our work, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. **Run the Code**: Navigate to the `api_requests/` directory and run the scripts to interact with the OpenAI API.
4. **Analyze the Results**: Navigate to the `results/` directory to analyze the experimental results.

## Experiment Tracking

We used [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) for experiment tracking. OpenAI's integration with Weights & Biases allows for easy synchronization of experiment results. Our experiment results can be accessed in our [Weights & Biases project page](https://api.wandb.ai/links/mars-works/b6w8u2mi).
